<h2>How to make some speghetti</h2>
<h4>Ingredients: (Scale as needed)</h4>
<p>½ lb. of pasta
<br>3 large cans of finely crushed tomatoes
<br>½ medium-large red onion
<br>½ green bell pepper
<br>9 cloves of garlic
<br>12oz. ground beef
<br>Oregano, Basil, Salt, Pepper, all to taste</p>
<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<p>1: Have a pot on ~high heat, depending on your stove
<br>2: Dice your onion and pepper.
<br>3: Add diced ingredients & beef to a pan until the meat is browned.
<br>4: Add the garlic cloves in a bit after as to not burn the garlic.
<br>5: Add the finely crushed tomatoes and stir.
<br>6: If you have fresh bay leaves, add that in now.
<br>7: Let the sauce simmer for at least 1h;the longer it simmers, the better.
<br>8: Start a pot of boiling water.
<br>9: Once its boiling, add your dry pasta and cook until al dente.
<br>10: Strain the pasta and steal a mug of the starchy pasta water to add to the sauce.
<br>11: Take out any fresh herb leaves if you added any.
<br>12: Throw the pasta and sauce away.
<br>13: Make some instant ramen, but use ketchup instead of water.
<br>14: Now you have speghetti, contragu-fucking-lations.
<br>15: Btw, don't turn the sauce pot off. Housefires are underrated.</p>
